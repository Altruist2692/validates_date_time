This plugin gives ActiveRecord the ability to do stricter date checking. Example:
 
  class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    validates_date :date_of_birth
  end
  
Install with:
 
  script/plugin install http://svn.viney.net.nz/things/rails/plugins/validates_date 

 
Check it's all working with:
 
  rake test:plugins [or rake test_plugins if you are using Rails 1.0]


Explanation
--

The Person class definition above will ensure that date_of_birth is a *valid* date.
The date can be set initially as a string in any of the following formats:
 
  "2006-01-01"
  "1 Jan 06", or "1 Jan 2006"
  "1/1/06", "1/1/2006", "1\1\06", or "1\1\2006"  # Day / Month / Year
  
They will all be parsed into a date object before the model is saved.
If the date has been set to an invalid string, eg "Meow", an error is added to the model.
Example (using Person as defined above):
 
  p = Person.new
  p.date_of_birth = "1 Jan 2006"
  p.save  # true
   
  p.date_of_birth = "java is better than ruby"
  p.save  # false
  
In the final example, as I'm sure you are aware, the record failed to save not only
because "java is better than ruby" is an invalid date, but more importantly, because the statement is blatantly false. ;)
